# PowerShell Detection: Multi-Model, Multi-Output

Welcome to the **PowerShell Detection Multi-Model Multi-Output** project!  
This repository provides a comprehensive machine learning toolkit for detecting malicious PowerShell scripts using advanced multi-model, multi-output architectures. Whether you are a security researcher, data scientist, or developer, this project aims to accelerate your journey in building robust PowerShell threat detection systems.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Model Architecture**: Integrates traditional ML models and advanced neural networks for robust detection.
- **Multi-Output Predictions**: Classifies scripts by both benign/malicious intent and possible attack techniques.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Step-by-step notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results visualization.
- **GAN Integration**: (Branch: `gan`) Leverage Generative Adversarial Networks to augment datasets and improve model generalization.
- **Extensible Codebase**: Modular functions for easy experimentation and adaptation to new datasets.
- **Multiple Branches**: Experiment with different approaches (`main`, `dev`, `dev_2`, `binary`, `gan`).
